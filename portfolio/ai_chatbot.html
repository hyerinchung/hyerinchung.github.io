  <h1>AI Chatbot</h1>

    <h2>What is AI chatbot?</h2>
    <p>
      In today’s digital world, AI chatbots are becoming more common in our daily lives. But what exactly are they?

      An AI chatbot is a computer program that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to simulate human conversation. These chatbots can understand natural language, respond to questions, and even carry on meaningful conversations. You might have seen them on websites, in apps, or as virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa.<br><br>

      Businesses use AI chatbots to provide customer support, answer frequently asked questions, or even help with shopping. We’re always striving to provide better and faster support for our customers. One way I’ve made this possible is through the AI-powered troubleshooting chatbot.

      This chatbot is designed specifically to help customers resolve common product issues on their own—quickly and conveniently. By offering easy-to-follow solutions and smart suggestions based on user input, the chatbot reduces downtime and improves customer satisfaction.
