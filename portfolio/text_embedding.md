# Text Embedding

## Introduction
Text embedding is a powerful technique used in natural language processing (NLP) to convert words, sentences, or even entire documents into numerical representations. These representations, often referred to as "embeddings," capture the semantic meaning of the text in a form that machine learning models can understand. By mapping text to dense vectors, text embeddings allow models to process and analyze language more effectively, enabling a wide range of applications such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, information retrieval, and more.
