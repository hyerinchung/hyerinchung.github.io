# 🏦 Bank Churn Prediction Project

Welcome to my Bank Churn Prediction project! This project focuses on identifying customers who are likely to leave a bank using machine learning techniques.

## 📌 Overview

In this project, I used a customer dataset and applied classification models to predict churn, including:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

## 📊 Features Used

Key features in the dataset:

- Credit Score
- Age
- Tenure
- Balance
- Number of Products
- Has Credit Card
- Is Active Member
- Estimated Salary

## 🧠 Model Performance

The models were evaluated using metrics like:

- Accuracy
- Precision & Recall
- ROC AUC Score

## 📎 Conclusion

The final model achieved over 83% accuracy and highlighted key churn factors such as age, account activity, and credit card usage.
