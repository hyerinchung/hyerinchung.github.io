- XGBoost

## 📊 Features Used

Key features in the dataset:

- Credit Score
- Age
- Tenure
- Balance
- Number of Products
- Has Credit Card
- Is Active Member
- Estimated Salary

## 🧠 Model Performance

The models were evaluated using metrics like:

- Accuracy
- Precision & Recall
- ROC AUC Score

## 📎 Conclusion

The final model achieved over 85% accuracy and highlighted key churn factors such as age, account activity, and credit card usage.
